# Hey there, stranger! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My name is **Sara** (a.k.a. _LonelyPrincess_ or _Natsuko Kuroigawa_ accross the web), and I'm currently working as a **full stack web developer**. 

The tech stack I use the most is [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org), as well as SQL databases. I also work with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for simple DevOps stuff. For this reason, most of the projects I collaborate in are based on this stack. 

As I'm currently learning about **videogame development**, you may also start seeing [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) projects among my repositories.

Aside from software development, I also enjoy writing, so feel free to check out some of my stories in [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/NatsukoKuroigawa) or articles in [Medium](https://medium.com/@lonelyprincess). You may also find me in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12911174).
